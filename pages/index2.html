                    <h3>Why did you choose this degree/certificate?</h3>
                    <p>When I was working at the company, I produced educational and promotional materials. It was a lot of fun.
                        After that, I became interested in design and wanted to study properly. After quitting the company, I came to study abroad and chose this program to learn what I wanted to learn.

                    <h3>What artist/designer inspires you? Why?</h3>
                    <p>I love Vincent Van Gogh. His brush touches and colors impress me. Find and read the letters exchanged between Vincent van Gogh and Theo van Gogh and tried to understand how Vincent felt when painting and choosing colors. His colors and paintings have had a great influence on my style.</p>

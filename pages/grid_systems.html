				Metaphor Ban
				(translation by Jack Jung)
				Metaphor has been stolen from the poet.
				The ocean is no longer a place of metaphor.
				n’t said metaphorically in a poem that she was entering water.
				A ribbon of metaphor was tied on the vast world.
				Forgiveness must be sought for these acts.
				
				Seasons have been stolen from the poet.
				After spring, summer does not follow. It is hot winter.
				Flowers blossom all at once then die all at once.
				n’t, who once described a bud of a flower was like a tightly held fist
				As a metaphor in a poem, must seek forgiveness.
				
				God was stolen from n’t.
				It is now hard to pray to God.
				
				For the chirping songs of baby chicks, forgiveness must be sought.
				This spring, the chicks got stuck on fences.
				They hang from people’s chests and sleeves.
				
				Black rain raining on stolen spring.
				From the eaves, pink flesh of stolen God
				Splattering down down down.
				I can’t bring myself to say that even the ocean is stolen.
				
				Is there any metaphor in this country now.
				
				Perhaps if we are forgiven
				Perhaps if every poem in this world is forgiven.</p>

				Playground
				From the blood of these knuckles 
				a red tree grows.
				Not red leaves or red flowers. 
				An entire red tree. 
				It loves and disdains me. 
				It doesn’t sing the moon a poem. 
				When I am near with my treasure map,
				wanting the gold, the babe who fell
				through my mother’s ceiling,
				it slaps me. It eats the babe.
				All gone. 
				The herds come. 
				The herds go ‘round. 
				They know.
				It suspends all treaties
				in its canopy. The sky,
				when it turns red, the red tree says look, 
				I did that. 
				And I look
				through the gaps in my fingers,
				no longer fingers, no longer gaps,
				just nubs
				upon the red fields. </p>

				School of Athens
				Because we missed the Raphaels the first time
				we crossed the Vatican twice. Twice
				with weary children down the long crowded galleries;
				twice the Sistine Chapel
				& the hushing of our awe.
				The matriarchs’ arms grew buffer;
				the damned were damned again. Einmal
				ist keinmal the Germans say, though
				they dream of Venice, not Rome.
				Once is nothing: even children get the feeling
				that they’ve lived this life before. Once
				I was nineteen, watching conservators
				brighten The School of Athens. Every city
				seemed another world but many worlds
				is not the same as many lives. If once is nothing
				then inferno is a loop, our gravest errors
				skipping until watertight as marble.
				In Venice, a kind Australian pulled our suitcase
				so I could carry our son. We’d missed
				our vaporetto stop, tired from driving all day. Soon
				our sons were drifting off in strange beds
				on the edge of the Dorsoduro. I’d been here
				once before: it was night
				& I was lost; the scent of baking bread
				drifted down from an open window.</p>
